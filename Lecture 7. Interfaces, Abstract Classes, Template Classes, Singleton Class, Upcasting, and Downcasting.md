#### **1. Interfaces**

- **Definition**:  
    An interface defines a contract with a set of methods that must be implemented by a class. It is typically used to achieve abstraction and multiple inheritance.
    
- **Key Points**:
    - It Doesn't have any body for methods
	- It is used to implement multiple inheritance 
	- Java add `public static final` keywords automatically in front of data members
	- `List<T>` is interface
    - Methods in an interface are abstract by default.
    - Can have static and default methods (Java 8+).
    - A class can implement multiple interfaces.
    - Also see [[Java Collections Framework]]
- **Syntax (Java)**:
    
    ```java
    interface PaymentGateway {
        void processPayment(double amount);
    }
    
    class PayPal implements PaymentGateway {
        public void processPayment(double amount) {
            System.out.println("Processing payment through PayPal: $" + amount);
        }
    }
    ```
    
- **Software Development Example**:  
    In an **e-commerce application**, you might define an interface `PaymentGateway` for integrating with multiple payment providers. Each provider (PayPal, Stripe, Razorpay) implements the interface with its specific logic.
    
- **Real-Life Example**:
	
	- **Interface**: A plug (interface) in your home defines a standard set of pins for all appliances.
	- **Implementation**: Devices like TVs and refrigerators provide their own logic for how electricity is used.

#### **2. Abstract Classes**

- **Definition**:  
    Abstract classes provide a base structure for other classes, allowing both concrete methods (with implementation) and abstract methods (without implementation).
    
- **Key Points**:
    
    - Cannot be instantiated.
    - Subclasses must implement abstract methods.
    - Used when multiple related classes share some common functionality.
- **Syntax (Java)**:
    
    ```java
    abstract class Database {
        abstract void connect();
        void disconnect() {
            System.out.println("Disconnecting from the database...");
        }
    }
    
    class MySQLDatabase extends Database {
        void connect() {
            System.out.println("Connecting to MySQL Database...");
        }
    }
    ```
    
- **Software Development Example**:  
    In a **data-driven application**, you might create an abstract class `Database` that defines common methods like `connect()` and `disconnect()`. Subclasses like `MySQLDatabase` and `PostgreSQLDatabase` provide specific implementations for connection logic.
- **Real-Life Example**:
	- **Abstract Class**: A _Vehicle_ is an abstract conceptâ€”it has wheels, an engine, etc., but can't be directly used.
	- **Subclasses**: Car, Truck, Bike, etc., define specific behavior (e.g., engine starting).

#### **3. Template Classes (Generics)**

- **Definition**:  
    Template classes allow the creation of reusable, type-safe classes or methods that can work with different data types.
    
- **Key Points**:
    
    - Common in Java, C++, and other languages.
    - Helps avoid duplication of code for similar logic applied to different data types.
- **Syntax (Java)**:
    
    ```java
    class Response<T> {
        private T data;
        public void setData(T data) {
            this.data = data;
        }
        public T getData() {
            return data;
        }
    }
    
    public class Main {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            Response<String> successResponse = new Response<>();
            successResponse.setData("Success!");
            System.out.println(successResponse.getData());
        }
    }
    ```
    
- **Software Development Example**:  
    In **REST API development**, you might use a generic `Response<T>` class to return responses with different data types (e.g., `Response<User>`, `Response<Product>`). This avoids writing separate response classes for every endpoint.
- **Real-Life Example**:
	- **Template**: A box that can hold anything (toys, clothes, books).
	- **Usage**: You define what you store in it at runtime.

#### **4. Singleton Class**

- **Definition**:  
    A Singleton ensures that only one instance of the class is created throughout the application and provides a global access point to it.
    
- **Key Points**:
    
    - Often used for shared resources like configuration, logging, or database connections.
    - Typically implemented with private constructors and a static instance.
- **Syntax (Java)**:
    
    ```java
    class Logger {
        private static Logger instance;
        private Logger() {}
        public static Logger getInstance() {
            if (instance == null) {
                instance = new Logger();
            }
            return instance;
        }
        public void log(String message) {
            System.out.println("LOG: " + message);
        }
    }
    ```
    
- **Software Development Example**:  
    In a **logging system**, a Singleton `Logger` ensures that all parts of the application write logs to the same destination, avoiding the creation of multiple log writers.
- **Real-Life Example**:
	- **Singleton**: A government in a country (only one exists).
	- **Usage**: You call it to manage centralized tasks.

#### **5. Upcasting and Downcasting**

- **Upcasting**:  
    Converting a subclass object to its superclass type.
    
    - **Why**: To enable polymorphism and generalize objects.
- **Syntax**:
    
    ```java
    Animal animal = new Dog(); // Upcasting
    animal.eat(); // Calls Dog's implementation
    ```
    
- **Software Development Example**:  
    In a **zoo management system**, you might treat all animals as `Animal` for general operations like feeding. Specific behaviors like barking or flying are not accessible during upcasting.
- **Real-Life Example**:
	- **Upcasting**: A _Cat_ or _Dog_ treated as an _Animal_ in a pet shop system.
	- **Downcasting**: When specifics like `Dog.bark()` or `Cat.purr()` are needed.

---

- **Downcasting**:  
    Converting a superclass object back to its subclass type.
    
    - **Why**: To access subclass-specific methods.
- **Syntax**:
    
    ```java
    Dog dog = (Dog) animal; // Downcasting
    dog.bark();
    ```
    
- **Software Development Example**:  
    In a **game development project**, you might have a base class `Character` and subclasses like `Warrior` or `Mage`. During combat, you downcast the `Character` to a specific subclass to use abilities like `warrior.shieldBlock()` or `mage.castSpell()`.
